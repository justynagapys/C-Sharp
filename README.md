## Exercises in programming in C#

A repository created for the purposes of classes at the university, monitoring progress in programming in C#.

Exercises based on the book **"Wprowadzenie do programowania - ITA-104"** (Włodarczyk Michał) prepared for *Microsoft IT Academy*.

Here you can find program that:
* draws 6 numbers (**TotoLotek**)
* inverts words of sentence (**OdwrocenieZdania**)
* replaces the first character with the last of the sentence given by the user (**ZamianaZnakow**)
* multiplies matrices (**MnozenieMacierzy**)

and others, as well as Windows Forms applications, such as **LiczbaPierwsza**, which checks if the number is prime.

Exercises have been written using **Visual Studio-IDE**.
